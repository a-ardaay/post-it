post-it  is a twitter-like, text-based web application developed using Flask, SQLite, and CS50 library. It allows users to post messages, follow other users, search for users and posts, and customize their profile.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can register, log in, and log out securely. Passwords are hashed using the Werkzeug security library.
- **Profile Customization**: Users can customize their display name, bio, and password.
- **Creating posts**: Logged-in users can create posts to share their thoughts and experiences.
- **Following System**: Users can follow other users to see their posts on their home page.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for other users by their usernames or display names and posts using the search feature.
- **Browse Posts**: Users can browse through all the posts on the platform without the need to log in.

## Usage

1. Register an account or log in if you already have one.
2. Customize your profile by editing your display name, bio, and password in the settings page.
3. Create posts to share your thoughts and experiences with other users.
4. Follow other users to see their posts on your home page.
5. Use the search functionality to find other users and posts.
6. Browse through all the posts on the platform in the home page.

## Design

Having taken a lot of inspiration from CS50x's Problem Set 9, this project was implemented using some components from CS50's Finance web app.

After creating an account and logging in, the user is welcomed by the home page which is stylized to have three main sections.

On the left side, the navigation bar stylized in the colors of post-it's logo, allows users to access the home-page, search for users or posts, see their profile and posts, change settings and log out.

Below the navigation bar is a dedicated "post-it" button where users can visit a new page with a bigger text area to make their posts.

In the middle of the page, users will find a "quick post" area at the top, where they can make a new post quickly as the name implies.

Below that area is the part where all posts are shown.

Posts are shown in a familiar design where the display name and the user name are shown on top, followed by the contents of the post and the date and time the post was created right below.

As per the implementation, only 50 posts are shown at a time on the home page but it can be added as an option to increase this number if desired so.

The right side of the page includes a small rectangular area where the user can see the details of their own profile, such as their display name, user name, bio and follower counts.

Clicking the "search" button on the left side will take the users to the search page where the users can make searches through the database.

The options include searching by display name, user name or contents of a post.

Below the search button, is the user profile which is a basic and static page that shows the user what their profile looks like to other users. In this page, the display name, user name, follower counts, their bio and all posts they created are shown.

In the "settings" page, the users are able to make changes to their account, such as changing their display name, bio and passwords. Changing usernames is not allowed in order to allow other users to be able to find users later on.

The last button on the navigation bar is the "log out" button, which as the name implies, will log the user out and redirect them to the login page.

## Some Implementation details

- As the data regarding the user profile is shown on each page, as part of the layout, it is made so that a database query is made every time a page is loaded, to get the user's profile data. It could be possible to get this data only once and store it somewhere else so that it is not requested from the server each time but considering the small volume of data, this was intentionally left this way.

- Regarding user-input, no precautions are taken such as making sure posts, usernames or passwords are fit to certain standards and it is left to end-user to be sensible with the data they send to the server.

- Search functions are only as good as the sqlite3's 'LIKE' keyword and no other detailed search functions were developed for this project.

- There may be some remnants from the CS50's Finance distribution code as some parts of the code were directly copied from there.

- User profiles and posts shown in the video were generated by OpenAI's LLM, ChatGPT for demonstration purposes.
